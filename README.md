# GWack Slack Simulator
A client and server that implements a chat room, similar to Slack.

## Running the program
First, compile the program with `make` (if you get a message saying "Nothing to be done for 'all'," run `make clean` and then `make`).

In a terminal window, `cd` to the repo's directory and run `java GWackChannel` to start the server.

In another window, `cd` to the repo's directory, run `java GWackClientGUI`, and  the program should open. To connect to the server, use `localhost` as the IP address and `2021` as the port.
